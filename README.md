First of all, the hour hand covers 30 degrees in 60 minutes, and it covers 0.5 degrees in 1 minute.
The minute hand, covers 6 degrees in 1 minute.

When the time is 03:15, the hour hand has covered a total distance of (3 * 30) + (15 * 0.5) = 97.5 degrees. The minute hand, during the same time, has covered a distance of 15 * 6 = 90 degrees. The difference between them is 97.5 - 90 = 7.5 degrees.
